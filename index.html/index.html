      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This website presents visualizations based on IoT / network traffic data.
        The dataset includes variables such as protocol type (DNS, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, MQTT,
        SMTP, SSH), packet counts, flow duration, device type (Camera, Laptop, Phone,
        Sensor, Smart_TV), CPU usage, and file transfers. The charts were created in
        Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, then exported as
        images and embedded here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the navigation bar above to explore:
        <strong>Bar Charts</strong> (packet counts by protocol and label),
        a <strong>Scatter Chart</strong> (flow duration vs. packet size),
        and <strong>Trend Charts</strong> (time-of-day patterns for packet counts, CPU
        usage, and file transfers).
