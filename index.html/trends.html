        <p class="chart-caption">
          The stacked area chart shows how total packet counts vary across the time-of-day
          categories (Afternoon, Evening, Morning, Night) for different device types
          such as Camera, Laptop, Phone, Sensor, and Smart_TV. The height of the stack
          at each time period reflects the overall traffic volume, while each colored
          band reveals which devices contribute most at different times.

      <h2>Average CPU Usage Over Time of Day</h2>
      <div class="chart-container">

             alt="Line chart: average CPU usage over time of day by device type">
        <p class="chart-caption">
          This line chart tracks the <strong>average CPU usage</strong> for each device
          type over the same time-of-day categories. It highlights when devices are most
          active computationally. For instance, some devices show peaks in the evening,
          suggesting heavier workloads or user activity during that period.
