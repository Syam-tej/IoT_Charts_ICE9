        <p class="chart-caption">
          This stacked bar chart shows total packet counts for each protocol (DNS, FTP, HTTP,
          HTTPS, MQTT, SMTP, SSH), divided into <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Attack</strong>
          traffic. The height of each bar represents the overall packet volume for that protocol,
          while the colored segments reveal how much of that traffic is normal vs. attack. In our
          dataset, normal traffic dominates for every protocol, but a noticeable portion of attack
          packets is still present.

             alt="Line chart: average CPU usage over time of day by device type">
        <p class="chart-caption">
          This line chart tracks the <strong>average CPU usage</strong> for each device
          type over the same time-of-day categories. It highlights when devices are most
          active computationally. For instance, some devices show peaks in the evening,
          suggesting heavier workloads or user activity during that period.
